# AresIRCd
AresIRCd is an attempt to write an IRC server in Ada. This is my first Ada project, so any tips would be appreciated.

Currently I'm just initializing the server out of testserver.adb. This will be changed when more progress is made on development.

## Todo
  * Everything

## Compiling
Run: gnatmake testserver.adb

## Running
Run: ./testserver
